- 👋 Hi, I’m @haeday, a beginner coder learning the ropes by starting with Python. 
- 👀 I’m interested in app development, hoping that I will be able to create an app of my own.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning through a software development online.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with peers and mentors to acquire and develop new skills.
- 📫 You can reach me through the messaging system here. 
- ⚡ A fun fact that I recently learned is that there are more lego people in this world than there are humans.
